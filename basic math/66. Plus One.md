# 66. Plus One


Given a **non-empty** array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        boolean spill_over = true;
        int tracker = digits.length-1;

        // Loop until we're done carrying digits or reached the end of the array
        while (spill_over && tracker >= 0) {
            int cur = digits[tracker];
            if (cur + 1 != 10) {
                spill_over = false;
                digits[tracker]++;
            } else {
                digits[tracker] = 0;
            }
            
            tracker--;
        }
        
        // Edge case, if we're given all 9's
        if (spill_over) {
            int[] edge = new int[digits.length + 1];
            edge[0] = 1;
            return edge;
        }
        
        return digits;
    }
}
```

## Why it works

For most numbers, you can simply increment the last digit and be done. The problem comes when that number is 9 and you have to carry over a digit to the next place. In that case I loop until there is no more carrying, then return the result. I choose this approach (with an edge case) due to space efficiency. If that's not an issue you can omit it.

# 171. Excel Sheet Column Number

Given a column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

For example:

```
    A -> 1
    B -> 2
    C -> 3
    ...
    Z -> 26
    AA -> 27
    AB -> 28 
    ...
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "A"
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "AB"
Output: 28
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "ZY"
Output: 701
```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int titleToNumber(String s) {
        int multiplier = 1;
        int res = 0;
        
        // Loop through the string starting at the end
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int cur = s.charAt(i) - ('A' - 1);
            res += cur * multiplier;
            multiplier *= 26;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Why it works

We start at the end of the string, where each letter increase will only represent plus one. As we move to the left, each respective letter increase represents an order of magnitude (x26) difference. We get the value of the letter by knowing that the ASCII value of 'A' is 65, and using that to our advantage.

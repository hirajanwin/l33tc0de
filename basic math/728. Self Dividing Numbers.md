# 728. Self Dividing Numbers

A *self-dividing number* is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
```

**Note:**

The boundaries of each input argument are `1 <= left <= right <= 10000`.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> selfDividingNumbers(int left, int right) {
        ArrayList<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int temp = left;
            boolean is_self_dividing = true;
                
            // Loop through all digits or until we find one that doesn't work
            while (temp != 0 && is_self_dividing) {
                int cur = temp % 10;
                temp /= 10;
                if (cur == 0 || left % cur != 0)
                    is_self_dividing = false;
            }
            
            // If every digit was divisible
            if (is_self_dividing)
                res.add(left);    
            
            left++;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Why it works

We loop through each number, from left to right, and within that number, we loop through each digit, seeing if it is valid (non-zero and divides evenly into the number). If it passes the check for each digit, we add it to the list.

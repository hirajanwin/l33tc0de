# 231. Power of Two

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 218
Output: false
```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return ((n & n-1) == 0 && n >= 1);
    }
}
```

## Why it works

I used bit manipulation for this problem, and exploited that fact that every power of two will be represented in binary by a 1, followed by a certain number of 0's. However, we also do have to take into account 0 and negative powers, hence the check that n >= 1.
